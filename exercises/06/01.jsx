// Exercise 06/01
// ===========
//
// We will take a short diversion here and explore "HOCs", or Higher-Order-Components.
// While the demo app doesn't define any HOCs directly, HOCs are one of the foundational advanced
// concepts in ReactJS, and can help abstract cross-cutting concerns across several components.
// They also showcase one of ReactJS' powerhouse features: composability.
//
// Although, while we won't define any inside the demo app, we will be using one -- arguably the most
// popular -- heavily when we explore Redux.
//
// Tasks
// --------
// ‚úÖ    You should define a `withMouse` HOC that injects the current mouse X and Y coordinates
// ‚úÖ    Your `withMouse` HOC should update the current coordinates in real time, as the user moves their mouse
// ‚úÖ    Your component should accept a `mouse` prop, which is an object containing the `x` and `y` nodes and correspond to
//        the current mouse (x,y) positions, respectively.
// ‚úÖ    Your component should render the current X, Y position by pulling the information from the `mouse` prop
//        The format should be: (x,y) including the parentheses.
//
// üö´   Styling is out of scope
// üö´   You are free to add additional text, markup, but we will only be looking for the current X, Y position of the mouse
//
// Tips
// ------
// üê®  Use the `onMouseMove` Synthetic DOM event to capture the current X and Y coords of the mouse
// üê®  Remember, you HOC `props` are READ-ONLY, so you'll have to store the updates somewhere else to trigger a re-render
//
